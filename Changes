Change history for Net::Statsd

0.07 - Fri Aug 10 09:16:20 CEST 2012

    Fixed tests failure when an already existing statsd server
    was already running on port 8125. The mock server will now
    use any available unprivileged port instead of 8125.

    Thanks to Joseph Crotty for reporting the problem and to
    Jacob Rideout for providing a working patch.

0.06 - Thu Jul 26 13:05:19 CEST 2012

    Changed ordering of functions and POD documentation
    to clarify public and private methods a bit more.
    Thanks to Andreas Marienborg.

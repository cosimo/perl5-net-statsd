Change history for Net::Statsd

0.08 - Sat Aug 11 22:55:53 CEST 2012

    Improved performance by a ~13x factor, optimizing the
    send code and reusing the same socket instead of creating
    a new one every time.

    Added a benchmarking script, to measure Net::Statsd
    throughput in msg/s.

    Thanks to Tim Bunce for these great patches.

    Fixed tests failure when an already existing statsd server
    was already running on port 8125. The mock server will now
    use any available unprivileged port instead of 8125.

    Thanks to Joseph Crotty for reporting the problem and to
    Jacob Rideout for providing a working patch.

    Changed ordering of functions and POD documentation
    to clarify public and private methods a bit more.
    Thanks to Andreas Marienborg.
